#Mission Statement

Why have we created Obituary Hub?

In my home growing up, it was a regular occurance over the breakfast table for them to read the obituary section of the newspaper and discuss people who had passed away. They would send condolences to friends and family of the deceased if they were acquainted, and sometimes make a plan to attend a funeral or make a donation based on the information contained in the obituary.

Fast forward to today. I find out that friends have died from Facebook. Death announcements and public expressions of mourning are interspersed amongst the political posts and advertisements.

We believe these beautiful and heavy words, communicating cherished stories and memories, and eliciting a deep emotional response from the reader, deserve a better ecosystem. This is why we created ObituaryHub. It is built with the dignity of the deceased in mind as well as the tender hearts of those in mourning. It is a place to celebrate life and honor death as a natural part of life.
