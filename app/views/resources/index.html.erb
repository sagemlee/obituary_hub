    <p class="lead">Across the country, newspapers are publishing an unprecedented number of obituaries because of the pandemic. ObituaryHub isn't yet capable of importing obituaries from sources other than the New York Times, and even those we are only to display the opening paragraph. At this phase, we rely on our growing community to add obituaries to our database. We invite you to join our efforts to share meaningful and interesting obituaries with a larger audience by signing up for an account and uploading obituaries from your community or any that you come across that are especially moving. This project is open source and we welcome contributions from developers, especially students interested in gaining open source experience.<p>
